<h1 id="esp32-c3-cad-assignment">ESP32-C3 CAD Assignment</h1>
<p>This assignment introduces students to microcontroller-based PCB
design using the ESP32-C3. By completing this assignment, students will
gain hands-on experience with schematic creation, footprint assignment,
PCB layout, and firmware programming using KiCad and the Arduino IDE.
Students will develop the necessary skills to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and create a PCB using standard tools</li>
<li>Understand the end-to-end process of PCB development: from schematic
design, CAD layout, assembly, and testing.</li>
<li>Have a PCB that can be used as a reference design for their capstone
projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="schematic-guide">Schematic Guide:</h2>
<p>First thing is to download KiCad: https://www.kicad.org Create a new
project called <code>[netid]_esp32c3DevBoard</code> and open
<code>[netid]_esp32c3DevBoard.sch</code>.</p>
<h3 id="microcontroller-setup">Microcontroller Setup</h3>
<p>When designing a PCB with a microcontroller unit (MCU), the best
place to start is its datasheet. For this particular assignment, the MCU
used will be an ESP32-C3. Its datasheet can be found in the following
link.
https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3_datasheet_en.pdf</p>
<p>Hit <code>a</code> to open the component add dialog. Search
<code>ESP32-C3</code> for an ESP32-C3 in an QFN package and click
<code>ok</code> to place the part.</p>

</figure>
<p>While here, add the following components</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <code>Conn_01x04_Pin</code>. These will be used for GPIO and
UART connectors</li>
<li><code>R</code> for resistors</li>
<li><code>C</code> for decoupling capacitors. Decoupling capacitors are
typically used to filter out noise.</li>
<li><code>GND</code> for a general ground</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <code>w</code> to start routing a new wire under the mouse,
left-click to finish routing, and <code>Esc</code> to cancel. For a
cleaner schematic, use labels to connect pins to the microcontroller.
Use <code>l</code> to place labels on pins or wires. Any two points with
the same label will behave as if connected by a wire. Use <code>Q</code>
for pins you will leave unconnected.</p>
<p>Begin connecting components using wires as in the picture below. You
can change the values of the passive components by hovering your cursor
over and double-clicking or pressing <code>v</code>. Complete the
schematic for the MCU following what is shown:</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="usb-c-setup">USB-C Setup</h3>
<p>Add the following components to your schematic to create the USB-C
component.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>USB_C_Receptacle_USB2.0_16P</code></li>
<li><code>R</code>, 2 resistors, they must have the value of
<code>5.1kOhm</code> to meet USB-C specifications. The schematic for the
USB-C Setup is below. Please make sure that your labels for
<code>D-</code> and <code>D+</code> pins are exactly
<code>USB_D_N</code> and <code>USB_D_P</code> respectively.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/usb-schematic.png" alt="Schematic for USB-C" />
</figure></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-setup">Power Setup</h3>
<p>Since the ESP32-C3 operates at <code>3.3V</code> we will use a
voltage regulator to convert <code>5V</code> from the USB-C connection
to our desired value. Add the following</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AMS1117-3.3</code></li>
<li><code>C</code>, 2 capacitors of with values of <code>22uF</code>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/ldo-schematic.png" alt="Schematic for linear dropout regulator" />
</figure>
The convention to follow when placing components in a block is for
power/signal to flow from left to right.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="motor-controller-setup">Motor Controller Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>L293</code>. This is the motor controller that is being used.
Please refer to https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf for more
information.</li>
<li><code>Conn_01x04_Pin</code>. This connector will contain the output
driving signals generated by the L293 IC.</li>
<li><code>R</code> for a resistor value of <code>10k Ohms</code>.</li>
<li><code>Conn_01x02_Pin</code>. This connector will be an input for a
power source to drive the motor.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/motor-controller.png" alt="L293 Motor Controller Schematic" />
</figure></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="antenna-setup">Antenna Setup</h3>
<p>The ESP32 offers wireless capability, which requires the use an
antenna that resonates at 2.4GHz. Add the following parts, and create
the schematic shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Antenna</code></li>
<li><code>C</code> for two placeholder capacitors</li>
<li><code>L</code> for a placeholder inductor</li>
</ul>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/antenna.png" alt="Antenna Schematic" />
</figure>
<p>The default antenna that you will be using is antenna
<code>AE2</code>, it is a ceramic chip antenna. However for groups that
would like to use an external antenna outside of this assignment,
<code>AE1</code> may be used instead by soldering a <code>0402</code>
sized <code>0 Ohm</code> resistor. For the best performance, you will
want to implement a matching networking. The matching network we are
using is called a <code>Pi</code> network. The values for these
components should be tuned for optimal performance, and that requires
more rigorous testing and experimentation. For this board we will simply
use a <code>0 ohm</code> jumper resistor instead of the inductor
<code>L1</code> to complete the electrical connection between the
<code>LNA_IN</code> on the MCU and the <code>AE2</code>. This is not
optimal and there is room for improvement, but it works. If your use
case requires stronger wireless capability, it is best practice to
include a placeholder matching network and then measure and test which
values for your capacitors and inductors will work best.</p>
<h3 id="bootstrapping-pins-and-reset-button">Bootstrapping Pins and
Reset Button</h3>
<p>Add the following parts for this portion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <code>SW_Push</code></li>
<li><code>R</code> for three pull up resistors with values
<code>10kOhm</code>.</li>
<li><code>C</code> for two <code>1uF</code> capacitors</li>
</ul>
<p>The final schematic should look like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/bootstrap.png" alt="BootStrapping Pins and Reset Schematic" />
</figure>
<p>The buttons define the boot modes and reset conditions for the ESP32.
A <code>bootmode</code> refers to the various ways a microcontroller can
be configured and initialized, often defined by the physical state of
hardware pins. Your firmware must match the specific bootmode that a
microcontroller is configured to or else it will not work. A common and
unfixable mistake is when a board is designed such that its bootmode
pins are permanently configured in an invalid way. Buttons (and
switches) to configure your MCU give your design options and flexibility
to program, mitigating risk in your PCB designs. Details on the ESP32C3
boot mode can be found on page 29 of its datasheet.</p>
<p>The reset button is implemented with a debouncing circuit to filter
out parasitic transitions caused by button presses. A deeper explanation
of this is provided under <code>Peripherals</code> of the following
webpage:
https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece445/wiki/#/kicad/index.md</p>
<!-- 
### JTAG/UART Setup
For this board, JTAG and UART will be setup for debugging and programming respectively. Add the following components:
* `Conn_01x04_Pin`
The pins connected from the ESP32C3 can be used as `GPIO` pins. For now, the schematic should look like this:
<figure align="center">
  <img src="Images/schematics/gpio-uart.png" alt="GPIO/UART Schematic" />
</figure> -->
<h3 id="crystal-setup">Crystal Setup</h3>
<p>The ESP32 requires a <code>40MHz</code> crystal. We will be using the
<code>ECS-400-10-37B2-CKY-TR</code> crystal. However, this part is not
natively found in the KiCAD library. So we will have to import it from
online.</p>
<p>A schematic symbol and footprint can be found on websites such as
<code>www.snapeda.com</code> or <code>app.ultralibrarian.com</code>.
Both will work if you do a search for your component. Oftentimes,
vendors like Digikey will include a link to a parts model under
<code>EDA/CAD Models</code> as shown below:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/cad-model.png" alt="Vendor Linking Models for usage" />
</figure>
<p>You may have to import CAD models for specific component in your
teams projects. For this part, the following links will allow you to
download a CAD model assuming that they are not deprecated.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.snapeda.com/parts/ECS-400-10-37B2-CKY-TR/ECS/view-part/?ref=digikey</li>
<li>https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ecs-inc/ECS-400-10-37B2-CKY-TR/14548829</li>
</ul>
Make sure to download a <code>2D Model</code> for
<code>KiCAD (V6 or later)</code>.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/download-model.png" alt="" />
</figure>
Once downloaded, open KiCad and in the top toolbar, click on
<code>Symbol Editor</code>.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/toolbar.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>From there, search <code>Device</code>, left click on it, then go to
<code>File &gt; Import &gt; Symbol</code>. This should open your file
editor, go to the directory where you downloaded the ECAD model and
select the file that ends with <code>.kicad_sym</code>. This will add
the schematic symbol of the crystal to your symbol editor. Make sure to
save after this. Your symbol editor should look something like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/symbol-editor.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Now you can finish your schematic adding the following
components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ECS-400-10-37B2-CKY-TR</code></li>
<li><code>C</code> for 10pF capacitors</li>
</ul>
Your final crystal schematic should look like this
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/crystal.png" alt="Crystal Schematic" />
</figure>
<p>When downloading an external CAD model, you will also need to import
its footprint into a library. Click on the footprint editor in the
toolbar:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/footprint_editor_toolbar.png" alt="Footprint Editor Toolbar" />
</figure>
<p>Click <code>Import &gt; Footprint</code> and go to your directory
where the CAD files for the crystal are located. Select the file with
the <code>.kicad_mod</code> file extension. This should populate the
footprint editor. Save the footprint into its appropriate library (in
this case Crystal).</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/save_footprint.png" alt="Footprint Editor Toolbar" />
</figure>
<h3 id="mounting-holes">Mounting Holes:</h3>
<p>It is important to add mounting holes to secure your PCB in its
respective enclosure. To do so, add four <code>Mounting Holes</code> to
your schematic.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/MountingHoles.png" alt="Mounting Holes Editor Toolbar" />
</figure>
<h3 id="finalizing-schematics">Finalizing Schematics:</h3>
Before moving on to the next stage, we will clean up and document our
schematic. Since screenshots of your schematics will go into your design
document, you should put some effort into keeping them neat and easy to
read. Use the graphic line tool to divide up your schematic, it is in
the righthand toolbar or you can press <code>i</code> to draw graphical
lines. Use the text tool to label each of these blocks.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/right-toolbar.png" alt="Graphical Tools" />
</figure>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/complete-schematic.png" alt="Complete Schematic" />
</figure>
<h3 id="footprint-assignments">Footprint Assignments</h3>
<p>After defining the schematics, it is now time to assign physical
footprints to each component. A footprint defines the area where a
component will be mounted and soldered onto the board, ensuring proper
electrical connections and mechanical attachment. It is a layout of pad,
outlines, and markings on a PCB that matches the physical dimensions and
pin configuration of a specific electronic component. Click on the
footprint assigment tool in the the toolbar:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/footprint-toolbar.png" alt="Footprint Editor Toolbar" />
</figure>
<p>KiCAD will bring up the footprint association window, containing
three panes. The left pane contains the categories of footprints, the
middle pane contains your parts that need footprints assigned to them,
and the right pane contains available footprints based on your filter
options.</p>
<p>We will start with the capacitors. We have 0805 sized capacitors that
we will solder by hand, so double-click
Capacitor_SMD:C_0805_…_HandSolder. Pay attention to the filter options
at the top of the window. <!-- * `Diode_SMD:D_SOD-923`  --></p>
<p>Assignment the following components to the rest of the board:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RF_Antenna:Johanson_2450AT43F0100</code></li>
<li><code>Connector_Coaxial:U.FL_Molex_MCRF_73412-0110_Vertical</code></li>
<li><code>Button_Switch_THT:SW_DIP_SPSTx02_Slide_9.78x7.26mm_W7.62mm_P2.54mm</code></li>
<li><code>Connector_USB:USB_C_Receptacle_G-Switch_GT-USB-7010ASV</code></li>
<li><code>Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm:PinHeader_1x04_P2.54mm_Vertical</code></li>
<li><code>Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm:PinHeader_1x02_P2.54mm_Vertical</code></li>
<li><code>Inductor_SMD:L_0805_2012Metric</code></li>
<li><code>Resistor_SMD:R_0805_2012Metric</code></li>
<li><code>Button_Switch_SMD:SW_SPST_B3U-1000P</code></li>
<li><code>Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-32-1EP_5x5mm_P0.5mm_EP3.7x3.7mm</code></li>
<li><code>Package_TO_SOT_SMD:SOT-223-3_TabPin2</code></li>
<li><code>Package_DIP:DIP-16_W7.62mm</code></li>
<li><code>Crystal:XTAL_ECS-400-10-37B2-CKY-TR</code> This is the crystal
that you imported from earlier.</li>
<li><code>MountingHole:MountingHole_3.2mm_M3</code> for M3 screws to
mount your board.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final assignments should look like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/footprint-assignment.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<h2 id="layout-guide">Layout Guide</h2>
<p>Now we will switch to the physical layout of the board. From the
schematic view, click on the following icon to switch views:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/layout-2-schematic.png" alt="Switch to PCB Layout" />
</figure>
<p>Start by clicking the
<code>Update PCB with changes made to schematic</code> button and place
the footprints somewhere in the middle of the page. If you make changes
to your schematic later on, you should use this button.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/schematics/pull-updates.png" alt="Pull Updates from PCB" />
</figure>
<p>After initially pulling in footprints from your schematic, it should
look something like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/update.png" alt="Initial Layout" />
</figure>
<p>The blue lines are unrouted nets and indicatew what component pads
are going to be connected together. To start, lets define the physical
cutout of the PCB. You can do this by drawing a shape with “Edge.Cuts”
selected in the toolbar.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/edge-cuts.png" alt="Define Edge Cuts" />
</figure>
Drawing a shape of size <code>65mmx55mm</code>, your layout should look
something like this:
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/edge-cut-defined.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>To make things a bit easier, we will add a ground plane to the front
and back side of our board that will automatically connect all GND nets
together for us. Any areas of filled in copper like this are known as
zones in KiCAD. We can do so by selecting <code>F.Cu</code> and
<code>"Draw Filled Zones"</code> in the toolbar</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/gnd-planes.png" alt="Define Ground Planes" />
</figure>
<p>Define the front and back ground planes to match the dimensions of
your edge cut layer so that your layout looks like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/front-ground.png" alt="Front and Back Ground planes define. The back plane is defined, but it is not visible since it is covered by the front ground plane. The back ground plane can be viewed by toggling the visibility of the front ground plane in the toolbar." />
</figure>
Now we can begin sorting the footprints. This is generally where most of
the time designing a PCB should be spent. The goal here is to untangle
the footprints so that airwires cross as little as possible. This makes
routing in the next section simpler and helps to keep traces short. To
save some time, below is a suggested layout for your board:
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/suggested-position.png" alt="Suggested layout." />
</figure>
As a note, to rotate a footprint to 45 degrees, go to
<code>Settings&gt; PCB Editor &gt; Editing Options</code> and change the
value in the box labeled “Step for rotate commands” to 45.
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/rot-45.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Once you have placed all your components, make sure the component
references are visible and not obscured by other footprints. You will
use these references when populating the board. ## Routing: The success
of your routing is dependent on your project. Typically, traces that are
high-speed, high-power, or highly parallel are prone to be more
sensitive to layout than slower data lines or GPIO. You should identify
and prioritze these first. In this particular board, we have the
following critical traces</p>
<ul>
<li><code>USB 2.0</code> data lines</li>
<li><code>RF 50 Ohm</code> trace for a <code>2.4GHz</code> antenna</li>
<li><code>40MHz</code> clock signal</li>
<li>Power Traces</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, critical connections often adhere to some sort of
standard like USB 2.0. Otherwise, you may find routing specifications
for component datasheet.</p>
<p>To define traces, click the dropdown
<code>Track: ... &gt; Edit pre-defined sizes...</code> and add track
widths for <code>7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mils</code>. These larger tracks
are used for the power traces.</p>
<p>Some useful shortcuts in KiCAD that you may use for routing are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x</code> - Add tracks</li>
<li><code>v</code> - Toggle front/back side of board</li>
<li><code>u</code> - Select all segments of a track</li>
<li><code>Del</code> - Delete selected track segments</li>
<li><code>b</code> - redraw zones (after moving footprints or
tracks)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="usb-2.0-differential-traces">USB 2.0 Differential Traces</h4>
<p>USB 2.0 defines a differential signaling pair, according to standard,
the differential trace impedance needs to be <code>90 Ohm</code>. You
should now define a differential pair with a width of
<code>17mils</code> and a gap of <code>8 mils</code>. The differential
impedance is dependent on the geometry of your traces as well as your
physical stackup. These dimensions were chosen by using a trace
impedance calculator that is available in KiCAD as well as other
websites.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/differential-pair.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p><code>6</code> initiates the process for routing differential pairs.
Draw traces labeled <code>USB_D_P</code> and <code>USB_D_N</code> from
the USB C connector to the ESP32.</p>
Since USB is a differential signal, the physical length of each line
should be equal. Given your routing, there may be some physical
differences in length. To fix this, skew can be intentionally introduced
in your routing. To do so, click on
<code>Tools &gt; Tune Skew of Differential Pair</code>. Your cursor
hovering over the differential pair should indicate how much length
mismatch there is: a
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/current-skew.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>By clicking on one of the traces and bringing your cursor into empty
space on the PCB, KiCAD will introduce a skew to make sure that the
lengths of each trace are the same.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/tune-skew.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<!-- #### RF Trace
Select a width of `40mils` and add a track from pin 1 of the microcontroller to the antenna as shown below:

<figure align="center">
  <img src="Images/layout/rf-trace.png" alt="" />
</figure> -->
<h3 id="routing-on-the-backside">Routing on the Backside</h3>
<p>When routing a PCB, you will will need to route traces on the
backside of the PCB since you will have traces on the same side that
need to cross. To do so, you need two vias, which are electrically
connected holes in the PCB. First route a trace on the front copper
side, place a via, route a trace on the backside, and place a via again
to enter the front side again. The example is shown below:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/backside-routing.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Continue routing the rest of the tracks. Use 20 mil tracks when
connecting power traces to the regulator, and the regulator to the
microcontroller. Otherwise, a <code>10mil</code> trace width for GPIO
and other trace will be okay.</p>
<p>Before moving on, make sure your trace sizes match the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB 2.0: <code>7 mils</code></li>
<li>Power Traces (VDD33, 5V): <code>25 mils</code></li>
<li>RF Traces: <code>40mils</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also have some spacing between your data traces to
mitigate cross talk. Generally, a separation of two to three times the
trace width is good rule of thumb to follow.</p>
<h3 id="no-fill-zone">No Fill Zone</h3>
<p>The ceramic antenna requires a no fill zone, where there will be no
copper pour when the PCB is manufactured. To define a zone, click on the
following in the toolbar.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/no-fill.png" alt="No Fill Zone Toolbar selection" />
</figure>
Use the following settings for the zone:
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/antenna-no-fill.png" alt="No Fill Zone Settings" />
</figure>
<p>Define a no fill zone rectangle with dimensions of
<code>10mmx55mm</code>. It should look like something below:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/antenna-zone.png" alt="Antenna No Fill Zone" />
</figure>
<h3 id="grounding">Grounding</h3>
<p>Press <code>b</code> to define a copper pour. This will fill the
empty space with copper that acts as a GND signal plane for your
circuit. Notice that in certain areas of the board there are
discontinuities in the copper fill, resulting in
<code>"copper islands"</code>. These can be problematic, however, they
are easily solved by utilized a stitching via.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/copper-island.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/stitching.png" alt="Stiched Via" />
</figure>
<p>Place other stitching GNDs vias through your board to ensure a return
path for your components throughout the board. This is a simple and
important step! The final board should look something like this:</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="Images/layout/final.png" alt="" />
</figure>
<h3 id="fabrication-outputs">Fabrication Outputs</h3>
<p>Click <code>File &gt; Fabrication Outputs &gt; Gerbers .gbr</code>.
Select an output directory, and click <code>Generate Drill Files</code>
and then <code>Plot</code>. This will populate your selected directory
with the necessary files that a manufacturer will need to create your
board. Zip this folder and submit to your respective manufacturer.</p>
